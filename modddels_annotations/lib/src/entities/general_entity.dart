/// 2. **General validation** : If this [GeneralEntity] is invalid as a whole,
///    then it becomes an [InvalidEntityGeneral] that holds the
///    [GeneralFailure].
/// 3. **â†’ Validations passed** : This [GeneralEntity] is valid, and becomes a
///    [ValidEntity] that holds the valid version of its modddels.
